# Title:  	Mean, Median and Mode
# Purpose:	Finds mean, median, and mode in a set of numbers

# Notes:	Create three functions that allow user to find mean, median, and mode
#			No hard coding

# Subgoals:
#			In mean functions, give user option for how many decimal places to round to
#			If even numbers in list, return both middle numbers for median
#			If multiple modes, return all of them
